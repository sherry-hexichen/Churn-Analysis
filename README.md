# Churn-Analysis
This project is the practicum project that was required by my Master's Degree. The industrial host was Dealer-FX Group Inc. located in Markham, Ontario.

Throughout the last three years, Dealer-FX's customers have been experiencing around 46% customer churn in their service departments. They are losing on high potential revenue opportunities since service departments in car dealerships have higher profit margins than their retail vehicle sales. Thus, Dealer-FX is interested in developing a solution that both: caters to their customer's needs and compliments their existing branches of business.

The managerial problem at hand is to: tailor a solution for car dealerships to reduce customer churn in their service department. Our team developed a predictive model to predict the likelihood of a customer churning in the next year, and evaluating the reasons for customer attrition in order to provide car dealerships with individualized insight into why their service department customers are leaving.
